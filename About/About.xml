	<description>ReGrowth is a mod deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Vanilla Expanded Series and the understanding how biomes work, what role they play in your game. Everything added was made to fit or mirror vanilla. From a simple UI texture to a new more complex system,being as performance and vanilla friendly is the main objective we have.

This is the module for the tropical biomes, adding new trees, terrain and plants to enhance how it looks and make it more unique.

ReGrowth is designed to be as lightweight as possible, adding the minimum of new code required for its auditions to work.
